*By Alex Demitri*

Street photography has always been about more than just pointing a camera at strangers. It's about **connection**, **timing**, and **storytelling**.

## Finding Your Vision

### Understanding Light

Natural light on city streets creates drama and mood. I look for:

- Golden hour reflections in windows
- Hard shadows from afternoon sun
- The soft glow of street lamps at dusk

### Composition Techniques

The rule of thirds works, but don't be afraid to break it. Sometimes the most compelling images come from:

1. Breaking traditional rules
2. Following your instinct
3. Capturing authentic moments

## My Workflow

> "The best camera is the one you have with you."

I typically shoot with my Leica M, using the [35mm Summilux lens](/gear) for its versatility.

Here's my basic approach:

1. Scout the location  
2. Observe patterns  
3. Wait for the moment  
4. Capture with intention  

### Post-Processing

I keep editing minimal — mostly adjusting:
- Contrast and exposure  
- **Selective** black and white conversion  
- Subtle *grain* for texture

## Tips for Beginners

**Be respectful** of your subjects. **Be patient** with yourself. *Practice daily.*

Happy shooting!
