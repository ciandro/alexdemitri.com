title: "The Art of Street Photography"\

excerpt: "Exploring the spontaneous moments and authentic stories found on city streets through my lens."\
---\
\
*By Alex Demitri*\
\
Street photography has always been about more than just pointing a camera at strangers. It's about **connection**, **timing**, and **storytelling**.\
\
---\
\
## Finding Your Vision\
\
### Understanding Light\
\
Natural light on city streets creates drama and mood. I look for:\
\
- Golden hour reflections in windows\
- Hard shadows from afternoon sun\
- The soft glow of street lamps at dusk\
\
### Composition Techniques\
\
The rule of thirds works, but don't be afraid to break it. Sometimes the most compelling images come from:\
\
1. Breaking traditional rules\
2. Following your instinct\
3. Capturing authentic moments\
\

\
## My Workflow\
\
> "The best camera is the one you have with you."\
\
I typically shoot with my Leica M, using the [35mm Summilux lens](/gear) for its versatility.\
\
Here's my basic approach:\
\
1. Scout the location  \
2. Observe patterns  \
3. Wait for the moment  \
4. Capture with intention  \
\
### Post-Processing\
\
I keep editing minimal \'97 mostly adjusting:\
- Contrast and exposure  \
- **Selective** black and white conversion  \
- Subtle *grain* for texture  \

\
## Tips for Beginners\
\
**Be respectful** of your subjects. **Be patient** with yourself. *Practice daily.*\
\
Happy shooting!\
\
\'97 Alex\
