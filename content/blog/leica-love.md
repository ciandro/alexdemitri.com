Photography for me has always been more than just capturing moments—it's a way of seeing, of feeling time, of translating silence into light. Over the years, I've gravitated toward a singular tool that truly reflects that ethos: the **Leica M range of cameras**. In this post I'll share why the Leica M is my choice, how I use it in my work and life, and what it has taught me about photography, travel, and the art of observation.

## Why the Leica M?

### A tool that respects time  
From the moment I first picked up a Leica M, I sensed a difference. It’s not just a camera—it carries a lineage of craftsmanship, clarity and quiet precision. Unlike many high-speed, mega-buttoned systems, the Leica M invites slowness. The manual focus, snap-shutter feel, and rangefinder framing all engage your senses differently.

That slowness matters. In an era of instant everything, I want to pause, reflect, choose the moment. The Leica M demands that. In doing so, it becomes a partner in the process—rather than just a tool.

### Build, design and minimalism  
The Leica M is beautifully designed: flawless finishing, mechanical precision, and minimal clutter. For someone who loves subtle elegance (and as you know my “Analog Poet” identity), it resonates deeply. The camera isn’t screaming for attention; it quietly stands ready. That minimalism carries over into my style: understated, thoughtful, rooted in analog aesthetics, travel memory, quiet elegance.

### Image quality & legacy lenses  
It goes beyond appearance. The image files, the lens options (especially the M-mount primes) and the “look” they deliver are distinctive. The Leica M lenses produce images that feel rich, tactile, textured—perfect for the mood I aim for in my portraits, travel frames, black & white studies. Using a Leica M connects me to decades of photographic heritage, while still delivering modern quality.

### A statement of intention  
Carrying a Leica M says something: I care about the craft. I value thoughtful composition, meaningful light, the imperfection of analog heritage. It aligns with how I live: not rushed, not overbuilt, but intentional.

## How I Use the Leica M in Practice

### My gear setup

- **Body**: I typically shoot with the Leica M10 (or newer) because it balances digital capability with that analog feel.
- **Lens choice**: A 35 mm summarises much of what I do—street, travel, environmental portrait. I also carry a 50 mm for tighter portraits, and occasionally a 90 mm for more intimate work.
- **Settings**: I favour aperture-priority or manual mode, ISO kept modest (Leica sensors handle this well). I often shoot in raw + monochrome preview to visualise mood.
- **Accessories**: Leather strap, minimal bag (I prefer something compact for travel), a couple of ND filters or UV if needed, but I deliberately avoid carrying too much gear.

### Shooting workflow

1. **Scout quietly** – I like to wander, observe, settle into a space before I shoot. The Leica M suits that pace.
2. **Compose in the rangefinder** – The viewfinder demands engagement. Framing feels more intentional.
3. **Set the mood** – I decide whether this moment is colour or black & white. Often, black & white for mood & story.
4. **Click with intention** – I don't fire bursts. I wait for the moment and release once.
5. **Review & reflect** – After a shoot, I review in a quiet space, favouring minimal selection and deep tagging for future use.

### Travel & documentary work  
When I travel—whether cities in Italy, landscapes in Idaho, or culturally rich spots elsewhere—the Leica M becomes part of my rhythm. It doesn’t dominate; it blends in. I can carry it without being weighed down. It aligns with my “Timeworn Vagabond” and “Analog Poet” collections: travel, memory, light, craftsmanship. The size, the silent shutter (on some models), the discreetness—they all help photograph candidly and authentically.

### Personal projects  
For personal work—portraits of friends, experiments in light, the occasional abstract piece—I lean heavily on the Leica M's strengths: character, clarity, mood. The camera invites me to slow down, reflect, hear the shutter, and engage consciously with subject and space.

## Why It Matters: The Philosophy Behind the Gear

### Less is more  
In our world of hyper-gear, thousands of pixels, 50 lens options, it’s easy to get lost in equipment. The Leica M reminds me of simplicity’s power. It echoes my preference for under-40mm watches, for understated elegance, for design rooted in timelessness—not trend. It’s about quality over quantity. Few tools, deeply used.

### The analog spirit  
Though digital, the Leica M carries the analog soul: mechanical shutter feel, manual focus traditions, lenses crafted decades earlier. This analog spirit aligns with my identity as the “Analog Poet.” It reminds me of film’s texture, of travel journals, of light falling on stone walls in Italy, of coffee in Venice at dawn.

### Story-telling through craft  
A photograph isn't just "a digital file." It's a story, memory, emotion. Using the Leica M isn't just about image quality—it's about telling stories with intention, framing moments as a poet might capture lines of verse. It's about light, shadow, form, silence, and narrative.

## Tips for You, If You're Considering Leica M

- **Rent or borrow first**: The rangefinder experience is different—spend a day with one before committing.
- **Focus on one lens**: 35 mm or 50 mm is a great start. Get to know it well.
- **Shoot manually**: Try manual focus as often as possible—it trains your eye.
- **Carry lightly**: One body, one lens, minimal accessories. Let your creativity, not gear, lead.
- **Print your work**: Leica images deserve more than screen—they reward physical print or fine-art paper.
- **Connect with community**: Leica users often share stories, hunts, craftsmanship. It adds richness.

## My Favourite Leica M Moments

- The dawn walk in Venice's Dorsoduro district, Leica M in hand, capturing soft mist over canals, minimal colour palette, echoes of my tech-lead life dissolving into travel mood.
- A spontaneous portrait in Nampa, Idaho: street-light glow, Leica M speed, honest face, shallow depth of field—it reminded me why I pick up a camera in everyday life.
- Midnight landscape in the Idaho backcountry: long exposure, Leica M stability, crisp stars above my analog poet soul.

## Closing Thoughts  
The Leica M isn’t just a camera for me—it’s a companion in a way of living. It aligns with my values: craft, minimalism, travel, analog elegance, intentional art. As I continue to build my photography portfolio, my writing, my personal brand as the “Analog Poet,” the Leica M remains central. It reminds me to slow down, to feel light, to see poetry in everyday scenes.

If you’re exploring photography, gear, or your own visual voice: I encourage you to pause, choose your tool with intention, carry it lightly, and let the lens teach you something about seeing. Because in the end, the camera is just the tool. The story is what you bring to it.

Think of the Leica M not as a gadget—but as an invitation.

Happy shooting.
